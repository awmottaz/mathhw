## Summary

The Homework document class, `mathhw.cls`, is designed with the graduate student in mind. LaTeX has a sharp learning curve, and although I believe any serious mathematicians today must develop a working knowledge of LaTeX, I also believe it should be easy for someone to get up and running creating beautifully typeset homework.

This document class provides a comprehensive collection of mathematics packages and macros. It also applies the best practices regarding typography (see [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71172/why-are-default-latex-margins-so-big) for some discussion on the matter). There are many other features, tweaks, and design choices contained within to help make this document class as useful and user-friendly as possible.
